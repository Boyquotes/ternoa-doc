# Getting Started

______________________________

# INSTALLATION ⌨️

We recommand to install ternoa-js in your project with Node.js using npm: 

`npm install ternoa-js`

And there you go! You're ready to use the latest stable version of the Ternoa-js SDK.

______________________________

## Fancy trying the upcoming features ? 

If you rather go with one of the most advanced version of the SDK, you can download either a **@beta** or the next **release candidate @rc** version. Those version contains some fixs to come but also some features that are not stable yet : @beta version are here as internal and public testing environement. Even though @rc versions are neither stable, they tend to be the closest ones to the production version.

You can check directly on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ternoa-js) the versions available and chose the one you need. **Take a look at the changelog** to know what we are cooking in each of them before installing : 

exemple to specify a version : `npm i ternoa-js@1.2.0-rc0`
