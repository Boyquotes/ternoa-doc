# Cookbook

## Overview

This section covers some basic use cases. These _**code snippets**_ allow you to discover the different way to use/interact with a feature, some options and best practices, and provides crusty information. _If you are looking for full exemple instead of short code snippets,_ you rather look at our [Ternoa-js dApp](https://e2e.ternoa.network/) and [gitHub](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-js-test-dapp) repo. Depending of the community requests and feedback, we will implement more of those cookbook examples and make them available for everyone below.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
