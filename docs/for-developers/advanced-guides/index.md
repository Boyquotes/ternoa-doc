# Advanced guide

This section covers some coding **key concepts**. These code snippets allow you to discover different ways to use/interact with a feature, some options and _best practices_, and provide _crusty information_. Depending on the community requests and feedback, we will implement more of those examples and make them available for everyone below.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
