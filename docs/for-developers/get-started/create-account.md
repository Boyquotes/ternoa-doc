# Create Your Ternoa Account

Before starting building your decentralized application (dApp) on top of the Ternoa chain you will need a **Ternoa account**.

## Step 1: Create Your Ternoa Account

### Download Ternoa Wallet App

The easiest way to create an account is to use the [Ternoa Wallet](/wiki/wallet/) ðŸ“±

## Step 2: Get Some Free Test CAPS tokens

Usually, you start building your dApp on the Alphanet network with claimed CAPS tokens from the faucet.
Extending it to the Mainnet network will be as simple as changing the WebSocket endpoint.

The Alphanet faucet provides you with some free test CAPS tokens to start building on Ternoa on the Alphanet network.

It is accessible via the [Ternoa website](https://faucet.ternoa.network/).

Paste your fresh Ternoa account address created previously (it starts with the number `5` e.g. `5DFAg6g9n3fNT2qRUjP5sJ7R2pXKZ99PLVDSt5a1psr7BFJ1`), verify the captcha and click on the `Claim` button.

You will receive alpha CAPS tokens in a few minutes.
