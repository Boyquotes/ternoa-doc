# Collection

## What is an NFT collection?

NFTs represent proof of ownership on the blockchain. Creators need a way to group NFTs in a higher order entity. This entity is a collection. If a collection is created, NFTs can be put in it at its creation or after.

The main objective of collections are to give a way to group NFTs. Grouping can have multiple meaning, eg. having the same NFT in a high quantity grouped in the same collection or having multiple NFTs sharing the same types of attributes, while still being different, gathered in one entity. This can ease navigation in dApps and more generally improve user experience while using Ternoa's chain.
