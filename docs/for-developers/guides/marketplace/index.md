# Marketplace & Auctions

Ternoa provides you with many basic and advanced marketplace features. Not only creating an NFT can be done in just a few lines of code but we also cover many marketplace usecases: Ternoa allows you to easily create functions to list for sale, English auction, unlist and NFT, and manage a marketplace.

## What is an NFT Marketplace? Why Auctions?

With the objective of seeling and buying NFTs, we created the marketplace entity. Each user can create his own marketplace and define rules that apply to who can put on sale, what is the listing (putting on sale) cost and what is the commission fee.

Ternoa also offers a different ways to sell an NFT: auctions. Auctions are a type of sale where the NFT seller sets a minimum price they are willing to sell their NFT and by defining the time duration. Buyers can place bids with the amount they are willing to pay for the NFT as long as it is above the minimum price. At the end of the time period, the NFT is sold to the highest bidder. Auctions are great way to hype the project or an NFT.
