# Rental NFT

## What is Rental NFT?

NFTs represent proof of ownership on the blockchain. Renting is a powerful tool for the NFT owners to make more out of their NFTs. An NFT rental agreement is an on chain rental contract, between the owner of an NFT and a renter (usually called rentee) who will have a temporary access to the NFT properties, against a rent fee (an amount or an NFT).
