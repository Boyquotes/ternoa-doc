## Ternoa-js SDK ⚙️ 

>**[Ternoa-js SDK](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-js)** has been thought with one intention: **it aims to be one of the easiest tool to build web3 projects on top of the Ternoa Chain**. 


Based on **Polkadot.js API** and **Javascript**, it offers application developers the ability to query substrate chains like the Ternoa chain. It provides a seamless experience and allows you to start building at a glance : an extra short init and just a few lines of code after, you will create your NFT.

You can submit any transaction to the chain to manage your NFTs or familiarize yourself with our helpers with the code snippets.
This application aims to be build by the community and is **the perfect entry door to learn how to use Ternoa SDK**, your contribution and interest are warm welcomed.

If you look for more global information about Ternoa, check our **[website](https://www.ternoa.network/)**.

## Installation ⌨️

We recommend installing ternoa-js in your project with Node.js using npm: 

```bash
npm install ternoa-js
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And there you go! You're ready to use the latest stable version of the Ternoa-js SDK.

## Fancy trying the upcoming features? 

If you rather go with one of the most advanced versions of the SDK, you can download either a **@beta** or the next **release candidate @rc** version. This version contains some fixes to come, but some features that are not stable yet: @beta version is an internal and public testing environment. Even though @rc versions are unstable, they tend to be the closest ones to the production version.

You can check the versions available directly on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ternoa-js) and choose the one you need.  **Take a look at the changelog** to know what we are cooking in each of them before installing: 

Example to specify a version: `npm i ternoa-js@1.2.0-rc0`
