# Accessibility

The true potential of any technology lies in its accessibility and adaptability. For blockchain to enable widespread digital ownership, it must be accessible to the largest group of creators and developers in the web development community.

Making blockchain accessible means simplifying its integration into web applications, providing easy-to-use APIs, and offering comprehensive documentation and developer tools. By lowering the barriers to entry, more developers can incorporate blockchain-based features into their platforms, driving innovation and expanding the reach of blockchain-enabled digital ownership solutions.

Ternoa is designed to offer open-source web-ready development frameworks to developers, built directly upon protocole primitives. Unlike most web languages SDKs available on other protocols, Ternoaâ€™s do not involve intermediate smart-contracts. Hence our frameworks for high-level developers do not imply any trade-offs in terms of decentralization and trust.
