# Interoperability

Ternoa is built on Substrate. Therefore it's naturally interoperable with Polkadot ecosystem. We plan to become a Polkadot Parachain, which can serve the entire Polkadot Parachain ecosystem.

Substrate is a development environment created to facilitate the creation of Blockchains thanks to a modular architecture that allows to considerably reduce the development cost and time of a Blockchain.

The ecosystem formed by the Substrate and the Polkadot Blockchain stood out in 2020 as the first project not based on the Ethereum Blockchain to integrate Chainlink, a leading decentralized oracle network solution. And enabling it to become « the main provider of oracles for all Substrate-based blockchains and, ultimately, for the entire Polkadot network »

The Ternoa Blockchain is based on the substrate framework to offer:
- The use of delegated proof of stake (Nominated-Proof-of-Stake abbreviated to NPOS) to validate transactions and thus securing the data.
- The possibility to connect to other Blockchains to be able to store the data on specialized infrastructures.
- The creation of Smart Contracts in order to create the different protocols allowing data to be transmitted/to transmit the data.
- The management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) which acts as a time capsule and allows the management of time capsules;

# The importance of multi-chain
Blockchains, because of their necessary overhead for things like consensus and encryption, suffer from congestion and slow transactions times. This results in higher transactions fees, poor user experience and ultimately lower user adoption.

For blockchain technology to become widely adopted, blockchains must become faster. One good way to speed things up is to develop purpose-built blockchains, rather than try and build dApps and smart contract on a do-it-all blockchain like Ethereum.

Because it only has to do one thing, targeted protocols can be developed on a purpose-built blockchain which are designed to optimize throughput. Purpose-built blockchains sound like the ideal solution, but they too come with a big hurdle.

Purpose-built blockchains are not natively interoperable. That means an ecosystem of purpose-built blockchains would be an ecosystem of blockchains that can’t talk to each other. Perhaps the one impediment to user adoption worse than slow blockchains are blockchains that don’t communicate with each other. For an blockchain ecosystem to work, the individual blockchains must be interoperable and form a cohesive user experience.
