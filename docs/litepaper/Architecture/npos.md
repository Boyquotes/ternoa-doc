# Nominated Proof-of-Stake

Ternoa adopts the Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) framework, setting itself apart through a distinctive validator selection process that determines which participants are authorized to engage in the consensus protocol. 

In this enhanced version of the traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) model, the right to validate and forge blocks is not just a function of token ownership. Instead, the system encourages a balanced distribution of power by delineating roles between validators, responsible for block creation and achieving consensus, and nominators, who delegate their stakes to validators they trust. 

This delegation empowers stakeholders to influence governance decisions and promotes a more democratic form of network maintenance, leading to a more secure and representative blockchain infrastructure as seen in platforms like Polkadot, which also employs NPoS to cultivate an inclusive and broadly governed ecosystem.
