# User Workflow

The user workflow is as follows: 

- Users encrypt their sensitive digital asset and store it on IPFS. 
- The encryption key is splitted and stored on a cluster of separate secure hardware (TEE) distributed around the world. There may be enterprise owners who provide their own TEE clusters.
- Only the real owner on the blockchain can retrieve the splitted keys and reconstruct the original key to decrypt the content of secret NFT. 
- The owner can also schedule a transfer, rent or delegate the ownership of the NFT to another user.
