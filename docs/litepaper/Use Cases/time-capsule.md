# Time Capsule


The idea behind Ternoa was to create augmented capabilities for NFTs. To that end we developed several unique NFT transfer protocols. With these protocols, Ternoa users can create dApps with unique functionality. And the one we'll discuss in this use case is the Capsule NFT.

Time capsules themselves have been around for millennia. A time capsule is a physical container holding objects or information, usually intended as a deliberate method of communicating with people in the future. And that's what the Ternoa Time Capsule dApp does, only with digital assets.

Ternoa Time Capsules are NFTs issued on the Ternoa blockchain. They are encrypted, stored (potentially for along time) and ultimately transferred to the intended recipient on a predetermined date.

# Time Capsule Protocols

With Ternoa, NFTs can now have a time component associated with them. In other words, they can be made inaccessible prior to a given date or event, and then accessible on or after that date. There are three ways to specify that future date in Ternoa, each with its own protocol.

With the **Big Day protocol,** users choose the exact date (day/month/year) when a Time Capsule will be sent. An ideal use case for this is sending the Time Capsule on a birthday or anniversary.

With the **Countdown protocol,** users can designate the number of days before sending the capsule (e.g., 30, 60, 90). With this protocol, users have the ability to reset the countdown timer as frequently as they wish. The Time Capsule can be programmed in such a way that each time it is opened, the countdown is restarted. An ideal use case for this is a monthly subscription for art or literature.

The **Death protocol** is unique for each country and is based on the results returned from APIs of public death registries. The Death protocol triggers the transmission of the Time Capsule to the beneficiary when the official registration of death is made. An ideal use case is to ensure that your digital assets are passed onto your heirs after your death.

As you can see, Time Capsules can be used to create a whole new experience in digital legacy. They enable users to control their digital life through time.
