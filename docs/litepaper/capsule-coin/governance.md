# Governance

CAPS play a role in Ternoa blockchain governance. 

The **Democracy module** manages the administration of the general stakeholders vote. Ternoa allows CAPS holders to be custodians of the network and to have a decision-making power regarding blockchain governance. Blockchain governance includes developments, partners, protocols, etc.

There are two different queues to which a proposal can be added, before it becomes a referendum:

1. **The proposal queue,** which comprises all public proposals
2. **The external queue,** which is comprised of a single proposal which comes from one of the external origins (such as a collective group).

At each launch period, a referendum is created from a proposal taken in turn from the proposal queue or from the external queue. Any CAPS holder in the system can vote on referendums. The voting system uses a fixed time vote by allowing the token holder to fix his or her conviction behind the vote. The conviction dictates how long the tokens are locked for, as well as the multiplier that scales the power of the vote.
