# Staking & Nomination

Staking is the voluntary wagering of “chips” in order to receive a reward or exchange. 

The Ternoa chain relies upon NPoS consensus. Hence, holders can stake their Capsule Coins to become, or nominate validators on the network.

Validators and nominators are rewarded with:

- CAPS paid by network users to create transactions on the blockchain as described in "Utility" section
- CAPS from the treasury pallet, distributed proportionally amongst the active set of validators
