# Fractionalization

NFTs are unique and have only a single owner at a time. Hence, the concept of F-NFTs came into existence to allow NFT owners to mint tokenized fractional NFTs and share the ownership of the asset with others. At times, a high-value asset like real estate or a luxury yacht will be impossible for everyone to own. It is where the fractional NFTs play a massive role in allowing people to invest a small sum of money to gain fractional ownership of a high-priced asset.

With Fractional NFTs, anyone can own a high-value asset at a low cost.
