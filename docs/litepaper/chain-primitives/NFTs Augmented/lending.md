# Lending

NFT lending is, therefore, the opportunity to access loans with NFTs as collateral. In other words, it is the practice of putting your NFT up as collateral for loans. NFT crypto lending, which is our main focus in this article, is accessing crypto loans against NFT collateral.

Through NFT loans, lenders can access passive income from loan interest payments. On the other hand, borrowers can enjoy more liquidity on their holdings until they are ready to sell their NFTs.
