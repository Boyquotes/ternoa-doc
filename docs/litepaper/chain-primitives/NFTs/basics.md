# Basics

Ternoaâ€™s NFT module provides basic functions to create and manage NFTs. These include the following:

**Mint, Burn, Transfer, Royalty, Delegation.**

Ternoa creates its own metadata model to provide minimum necessary to have the capability to augment it in highly secure way.

| owner        | Address of the current owner of the NFT                 | M
| creator | Address of the creator of the NFT and the receiver of the royalty         | I
| offchain_data         | Link/Text/IPFS hash of JSON   | I
| royalty     | Royalty fee associated to the NFT | M
