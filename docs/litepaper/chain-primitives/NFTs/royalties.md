# Royalties

Royalties give to the creator a percentage of the sale price each time his NFT is traded on a Ternoa chain. NFT royalty payments are perpetual and are executed automatically.

# Royalty Share

With the Royalty Share feature on Ternoa, multiple creators can collaborate in the production of an NFT project and get a percentage of future sales on these NFTs.
