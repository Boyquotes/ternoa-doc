# Transfer Protocols

Ternoa has created transfer protocols to send your NFTs trough specific configured events. The specific protocols are detailed below.

# Safe Protocol
With the Safe protocol, users can store data on the Ternoa blockchain for a defined period of time, and can access it at any time.

# Big Day Protocol
With the Big Day protocol, users choose the exact date (day/month/year) when a capsule will be sent.

- Example #1: Alice wants to prepare a capsule for Bob who has to go abroad on January 17, 2021. She prepares a capsule for her and for him with all the necessary elements inside: tickets, hotel reservations, etc.

- Example #2: Bob prepares a capsule for Alice's 40th birthday. He adds messages and photos that will automatically be sent to Alice on the date specified by the Big Day protocol.

# Countdown
With the Countdown protocol, users designate the number of days before sending the capsule. Users have the ability to reset the countdown times as frequently as they wish.

- Example #1: Alice goes alone to the mountain for a hike. She schedules a backup capsule that will be sent to Bob if she does not connect for three days.
- Example #2: Bob wishes to give Alice his Ledger keys so that she can manage his crypto currencies after his death. Not wishing to indicate his identity, he creates a capsule with a one-year countdown.

# Consent Protocol
With the Consent protocol, users authorize a group to trigger the sending of a capsule. The user has a time limit to oppose it.

- Example: Alice manages the wallet of a large SME. She has a stroke and ends up in the hospital. The group of Bob, Christelle and Diane are designated as authorized to send the capsule. They trigger the action and if Alice does not oppose it, the entitled party gets the keys to the wallet.

# Death Protocol
The Death protocol is unique for each country and is based on the results returned from APIs of public death registries. The Death protocol triggers the transmission of the capsule when the official registration of the beneficiary's death is made.

- Example: Alice has a car accident and passes away. She appears in the death register. The oracle becomes aware of it and transfers the capsule to its beneficiaries.
