# üñºÔ∏è Marketplace 

## Simple Summary

NFTs represent proof of ownership on the blockchain. Creators need a way to group NFTs in a higher order entity. This entity is a collection. If a collection is created, NFTs can be put in it at its creation or after.
**Marketplaces are entities used, primarily, to sell and buy NFTs.** A marketplace's ownership and rules are also defined by the chain.
## Abstract

In the objective of seeling and buying NFTs, we created the marketplace entity. Each user can create his own marketplace and define rules that apply to who can put on sale, what is the listing (putting on sale) cost and what is the commission fee. **This document descrive the motivation and specification of the marketplace entity.**

## üéØ Motivation

The main objective of marketplaces is to have a support / media to exchange NFTs other than plain P2P transfer. Having marketplaces allows user to define price for their NFTs. **Those NFTs can be art, gaming items, tickets or any asset that can be represneted by a digital entity.**

## üëæ NFT Types

- **Digital Artwork** - This is one of the most popular forms of NFT. Think of it as a digital version of physical paintings, drawings and photographs

- **Music NFTs** - By selling music in the form of NFTs, artists can benefit from reaching their fans directly, avoiding concerns about music piracy and intermediaries. Example: Deadmau, Snoop Dogg

- **Video Clips and Gifs** - These NFTs can be motion version of paintings and digital drawings. But they can be loop version of videos or memorable sports moments, among many other. Example: NBA TopShot

- **Memes** - NFT memes are funny as regular ones, with difference that they can be minted, traded or owned. Example: Doge, Shiba, Pepe

- **Avatars/PFPs** - Profile Pictures collections (PFPs) often have many unique avatars that vary in rarity according to their traits. Example: BAYC, Crypto Kitties

- **Video Games NFTs** - Blockchain games allow players to buy, collect and trade NFTs in multiple forms such as characters, virtual weapons, power ups, skins, etc. Example: Axie Infinity

- **Trading Cards** - These NFTs are the evolution of the traditional collectible cards and have a dual use: to play in the game and as a collectible. Example: MetaFight, Sorare

- **Metaverse Land** - Metaverse allows users to interact with a virtual ecosystem, where they can buy, sell, trade and own virtual real estate. Example: Decentraland, Sandbox

- **Virtual Fashion** - Consider this type of NFT as a digital closet for the virtual life, where a user can find anything to wear: sneakers, hoodies, sunglasses, even skins for the avatar. Example: Adidas dressing Bored Apes

- **Text Based NFTs** - Literary works to a single text, anything written can be minted as a NFT. Example: 20mint, Jack Dorsey‚Äôs tweet

- **Ticket & Membership NFTs** - These NFTs can serve as entry tickets for events within a certain metaverse or as commemorative tickets for physical events, like concerts or sport matches. Example: 2022 Super Bowl received a commemorative NFT virtual ticket

- **Real-World Assets** - Anything physical can be represented by an NFT. This tokenization of real world assets introduces flexibility and record keeping of ownership. Example: Cars, houses, lands can be represented by an NFT certificate

## üõ†Ô∏è Specification

### Marketplace Types
```rust
types {
	/// Possible operations.
	pub enum ConfigOp {
		Noop, // Don't change.
		Set(T), // Set the given value.
		Remove, // Remove the value.
	}

	/// Multiple form of fees
	pub enum CompoundFee<Balance> {
		Flat(Balance) // A flat amount of token,
		Percentage(Permill) // A percentage of token,
	}
}
```
### Marketplace External Interfaces
Marketplaces support the following onchain interfaces:
```rust
interface {
  /// Interface Id: TIP200-01
  /// Description: User can create a marketplace specifying the kind.
  /// 	The kind is the type of marketplace, it can be public or private. 
  /// 	Public mean that anyone can list except the addresses put in the account_list (ban_list).
  /// 	Private mean that no one can list except the addresses put in the account_list (allow_list).
  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///       - The user must have enough funds to cover for the marketplace mint fee
  create_marketplace(kind: MarketplaceType);
  
  /// Interface Id: TIP200-02
  /// Description: User can transfer ownership of a marketplace.
  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///       - User must be the owner of the marketplace

  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///       - User must be the owner of the marketplace
  ///	    - If public -> private, accout_list becomes an allow list instead of a ban list
 ///	    - If private -> public, accout_list becomes a ban list instead of an allow list
  set_marketplace_kind(marketplace_id: MarketplaceId, recipient: AccountId);

  /// Interface Id: TIP200-04
  /// Description: User can change the configuration option of the marketplace. He can change the commission_fee, the listing_fee, the account_list and the offchain data.
  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///       - User must be the owner of the marketplace
  set_marketplace_configuration(marketplace_id: MarketplaceId, commission_fee: ConfigOp<CompoundFee<Balance>>, listing_fee: ConfigOp<CompoundFee<Balance>>, account_list: ConfigOp<BoundedVec<AccountId, AccountSizeLimit>>, offchain_data: ConfigOp<BoundedVec<u8, offchainDataLimit>>);

  /// Interface Id: TIP200-05
  /// Description: User can list an NFT for direct sale if authorized in the marketplace.

  /// Description: User can unlist a listed NFT.
  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///		- NFT must to be on sale
  ///       - User must to be the owner of the NFT
  unlist_nft(nft_id: NFTId);
  
  /// Interface Id: TIP200-07
  /// Description: User can buy a listed NFT.
  /// Constraint(s): 
  ///		- NFT needs to be on sale
  ///       	- User must not be the owner of the NFT
  ///		- User must have enough funds to pay the NFT price
  buy_nft(nft_id: NFTId);
}

## Additional Info

## Metadata

Marketplaces, like NFTs and collections, have their own metadata that are stored in json in either IPFS, a private server, any other type of storage. Metadatas cannot be enforced but we suggest this format:
```json
{
	"name":"This the title of the collection",
	"logo":"Hash / Link to the logo",
}
```
This metadata is stored offchain and only the CID (in case of IPFS), the link or the string corresponding to offchain data, will be stored on chain.
