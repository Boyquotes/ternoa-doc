# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome  

**Welcome to Ternoa Docs, the hub for those interested in learning, building, or maintaining the Ternoa ecosystem. This documentation will provide you with everything you need to get started with Ternoa as a user or developer.**

## What is Ternoa?

[Ternoa](https://www.ternoa.network/) is an open-source substrate-based layer 1 blockchain, designed to unlock the endless capabilities of NFTs.

Ternoa designs an infrastructure to accelerate web3 development by making next-generation NFTs easy to build on our blockchain. The Ternoa ecosystem facilitates the adoption of NFTs by giving developers a full technological stack and access to independent infrastructure, nodes, developer communities, and funding.

Creating NFTs and building dApps on most blockchains is complex. Ternoa was designed to break barriers for developers, web3 enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs and empower them to save time and money.

We believe mass adoption of NFTs is only possible with a fundamental tech evolution. In this guide, we have developed a range of tools to walk you through how to use and build on Ternoa for the first time.
