Gtoken is a non-fungible utility token used within the Ternoa network, not mineable or tradable with other fungible tokens. Ternoa has developed GToken to improve gameplay and security in the video gaming industry, allowing players to perform in-game transactions without stopping gameplay, simplifying in-game purchases for game developers, and enhancing security by eliminating the need for players to expose their private keys.
