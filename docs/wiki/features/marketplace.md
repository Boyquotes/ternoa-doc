# Marketplace

Marketplaces are online platforms that facilitate the listing and sales of NFTs, while giving artists a platform to display their work and collectors the ability to discover new art. Ternoa allows anyone to create their own marketplace, reducing friction in the buying process. Marketplaces can be used to exchange various kinds of NFTs, from artwork to gaming items. An artist can create their own marketplace to sell NFTs directly from their website, while a gaming company can create a marketplace for players to trade in-game items as NFTs, creating a secure and transparent exchange and incentivizing players to continue playing and collecting rare items.
